# Appendix E: Biome–Resource Affinity Matrix ⚠️

> Phase 4b of the Eternal Game Base Module Quantification Plan.

> ⚠️ **Flagged for full review.** All affinity values are starting estimates pending validation against yield rates (Phase 6) and crafting recipes (Phase 7). Resource-biome relationships may need adjustment once production chains are quantified.
> Dependencies: Phase 3 (resource catalog — Appendix F), Phase 4a (biome properties — Appendix D).
> This matrix defines which raw resources can appear in each biome. It drives world generation (resource node seeding) and production yields.

## How to Read This Matrix

- **✓** = Resource can appear in this biome (standard chance, 1× node frequency)
- **◆** = Primary biome — resource is common here (2× node frequency)
- **★** = Signature biome — resource strongly associated with this biome (3× node frequency, higher yield multiplier)
- **—** = Resource cannot appear in this biome
- Resources marked "universal" can appear in any biome that supports their gathering type

> Node frequency multipliers affect how often a resource node is seeded during world generation. Yield multipliers affect how much is gathered per action. Both are further modified by area rarity and individual node seed.

> **All affinity matrices are unlocked** — these are starting values. Game Masters may adjust resource-biome affinities via consensus. The resource catalog itself (Appendix F) and the biome list (Appendix D) are 🔒 locked.

## 2. Logging Resources by Biome

Logging requires forestry areas. Biomes with no trees cannot generate forestry areas.

Universal rare drop (any logging activity): **Worldroot**.

> **Key changes from v0.1:**
> - **Rainforest** is the new signature biome for Moonwood (ancient temperate forests with centuries of moonlight exposure).
> - **Forest** drops from Moonwood primary to standard — Rainforest is older and wetter, better for moonlight-soaked timber.
> - **Woodland** gets standard Wood (primary), Ironwood, and Hartwood access — open-canopy timber.
> - **Blight** has distorted logging — Wood (standard), Resin (standard). Twisted trees yield usable but unsettling timber.
> - **Mangrove** has logging — dense salt-resistant wood, Resin from mangrove sap.
> - **Scrubland** has minimal logging — scrubby trees yield standard Wood only.
> - **Marsh** has no logging — reeds and grasses, no trees.

> - **Scrubland** is the new signature biome for Dye Plants (indigo, woad, madder thrive in Mediterranean climates).
> - **Rainforest** has no farming — too wet, too dense, too much shade. Foraging compensates.
> - Oasis column removed (biome removed). Jungle inherits its tropical crop signatures.

## 5. Hunting Fauna by Biome

Hunting targets wild fauna. Fauna type and density vary by biome. Beast parts yielded depend on beast tier (see Appendix D §3 and Appendix F §4).

## 6. Fishing by Biome

Fishing requires a water biome or water-adjacent hex. Only Coast, Lake, Mangrove, Swamp, and Marsh support fishing in the base module.

| Resource | Rarity | Coast | Lake | Mangrove | Swamp | Marsh |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Fish** | C | ★ | ★ | ★ | ✓ | ✓ |

> **Mangrove** is the third signature fishing biome — tidal root systems create sheltered nurseries that concentrate fish.

## 7. Herding by Biome

Herding requires fertile areas converted from native vegetation. Biome determines which livestock types are viable and their productivity multiplier.

> **Legend**: ★ = ideal, ◆ = good, ✓ = viable, ☆ = marginal (50% yield penalty), — = not viable.
>
> **Key changes from v0.1:**
> - **Woodland** gets viable herding for all livestock types — open canopy allows some grazing.
> - **Scrubland** gets marginal Cattle/Horses (rocky terrain limits grazing) and viable Sheep/Poultry.
> - No herding in infertile biomes (Desert, Badlands, Canyon, Mire, Tundra, Glacier, Scorched, Glassfields, Blight, Mangrove).
